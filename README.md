# Tetris_Game
- Passion project created to play Tetris using a AVR Microcontroller to handle other electrical components through task scheduling and SPI communication.
- Developed firmware in embedded C to achieve efficient, low-level control of the microcontroller, optimizing performance and resource utilization.
- Utilized timers, flash memory, and peripheral interfaces like SPI to implement a round-robin scheduler.
- Designed with the AVR Library to program an ATmega328P, optimizing for embedded systems.
